# Using assign, blocks and layouts in Handlebars

Using the `partial` and `block` build-in plugin helpers you can extend a template layout with many blocks.
You can assign many variables, which will be available in a partial.

Use the [HTML Builder Plugin](https://github.com/webdiscus/html-bundler-webpack-plugin) for Webpack
to compile and bundle source Sass and JavaScript in template.
